## Simple Vue Practice App

### How to run
Simply clone the project and run `npm run dev`.
Or, if you have "serve" installed, simply run `serve -s dist`.

This is an app written in Vue that I made in order to show my interest in working for byte5, as well as showing that I learn fast and am actually willing to learn new stuff without resistance.

This app is not meant to be a showcase of any best practices be it logic, style, structure, etc, although I tried, in the 1 day I had to make it, to write it as best as I could.
