        <div class="about-me">
            <p>I’m a programmer from Brazil, having started my career as a programmer in Russia. Even though my Bachelor’s degree is in Business Administration, I rediscovered my love for programming back in 2017 and have been self-studying ever since.</p>
            <p>At my first job, I single-handedly created a massive platform from scratch using the skills mentioned below. I also maintained and added new features to the previous platform before the release of the new one.</p>
            <p>And at my previous job I was responsible for maintaining and upgrading a massive CRM platform, as well as writing full-stack applications.</p>
            <p>Learning is something I’m really passionate about, and I thrive in collaborative work environments. I’m highly motivated, especially when I feel that my contributions are valued and appreciated by the company.</p>
